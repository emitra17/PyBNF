Installation
============

Operating System
----------------
PyBNF can be installed on any recent Linux or macOS operating system. Windows is not currently supported. 

Python
------

PyBNF requires an installation of Python version 3.5 or higher. This comes built-in on many new Linux and Mac
operating systems. To check if you have Python 3, run the command ``python3``. This will start Python and print
the version number, or will give an error if you don't have Python 3.

Also confirm that your Python 3 has the ``pip`` package manager, which is used to install PyBNF. Run the command ``python3 -m pip``. This will give a help message if you have pip, or an error if not. 

If you are missing python3 or pip, an easy way to get them is by installing the `Anaconda`_ Python distribution for Python v3.5 or higher.
Instructions for installing on various platforms can be found on the `Anaconda`_ website.

PyBNF
-----

Installing from PyPI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Simply type the following in a terminal:

    :command:`python3 -m pip install pybnf`

The above command will use your current version of Python 3 to install the most recent version of PyBNF released on the Python Package Index, along with all required dependencies. 

Depending on your Python configuration, the above command may require root access and install PyBNF for all users on the computer. If you don't want to do this, you may add the flag ``--user`` to the end of the command, to install without root access for only the current user. 

Advanced Python users may consider installing PyBNF in a `virtualenv`_ (which also does not require root access) to avoid conflicts between PyBNF's dependencies and other uses of Python on the computer. 

Installing from source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To use bleeding edge PyBNF, the source code may be found on GitHub at https://github.com/lanl/PyBNF .  To use,
simply download or clone the repository and run the following command in the repository's root directory:

    :command:`python3 -m pip install -e .`

This also allows developers to modify the source code while still having access to the commmand line functionality
anywhere in the filesystem.


Installation of External Simulators
-----------------------------------

BioNetGen
^^^^^^^^^
PyBNF is designed to work with simulators present in the BioNetGen software suite, version 2.3, available for download from 
the `BioNetGen`_ website. Note that for Linux distributions other than Ubuntu, the pre-built binary is unreliable, and it is 
necessary to rebuild BioNetGen from source. The current BioNetGen distribution includes support for both network-based 
simulations and network-free simulations. 

.. _set_bng_path:
\


PyBNF will need to know the location of BioNetGen â€“ specifically the location of the script ``BNG2.pl`` within the
BioNetGen installation. This path can be included in the PyBNF configuration file with the :ref:`bng_command <bng_command>` key. 
A convenient alternative is to set the environment variable ``BNGPATH`` to the BioNetGen directory using the following command:

    :command:`export BNGPATH=/path/to/bng2`

where ``/path/to/bng2`` is the path to the folder containing ``BNG2.pl``, not including the "BNG2.pl" file name. This 
setting may be made permanent as of your next login, by copying above command into the file ``.bash_profile``
in your home directory.

SBML
^^^^
PyBNF runs simulations of `SBML`_ models using `libroadrunner`_, which is installed automatically through ``pip`` as part of 
PyBNF installation. 

To work with SBML files, it is useful to install software such as `COPASI`_ that is capable of reading and writing models in
SBML format.
