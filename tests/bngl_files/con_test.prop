# Satisfied 
B<10 always weight 2

# Penalty 2*2=4
# Uses the convention (for now) of going to the earlier time point if the "at" condition is between 2 time points
B<C at A=5.5 weight 2

# Penalty 0.2*2=0.4
6<D once weight 2

# Should go between times 2 and 4
# Penalty 0.2*2=0.4
5.4<D between A=3.5,B=6 weight 2

# Satisfied because A=5
A>=5 at 4.1 weight 5 min 2

# Triggers the min penalty, should be 10
A>5 at 4.1 weight 5 min 2

# Constraint is failed, but the altpenalty is 0
A>5 at 4.1 weight 5 altpenalty B<9

# Should get 25 from the altpenalty
A>5 at 4.1 weight 5 altpenalty B<3

# Should get 20 because the min 4 is bigger than the altpenalty 2
A>5 at 4.1 weight 5 altpenalty B<6 min 4

# Evaluates at time 1,2,3,4,5 for penalties (0,1,2,3,4)*2 = 20 
A < 2 at C=5.5 everytime weight 2

# Triggers at time 2 and 4 (requires equality of at condition to work)
# Penalty 3 * (0.2 + 0.4) = 1.8
D <= 5 at B=8 everytime weight 3

# Should apply from time= 2 to 4 inclusive. Each should get penalty of 1.
A<4 between C=6,C=6
A>4 between C=6,C=6

# First point does not occur, so penalty is automatically 0
D>5000 between B=10,time=7 weight 2

# Second point does not occur after the first point, so interval lasts until the end
# Penalty 0.8 * 2 = 1.6
D<5 between A=5,A=4 weight 2

# Triggers at time 1 (before time 2), for a penalty of 0.1
D <= 5 at B=8 before

# A at 3 = 4; B before C=9 is 2, so penalty is 5*2 = 10
A at 3 < B at C=9 before weight 5
