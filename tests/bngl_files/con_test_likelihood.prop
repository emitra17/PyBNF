# Satisfied, no penalty
B<10 always confidence 1 tolerance 0

# Satisfied, penalty should be -ln(0.95)
B<=9 always confidence 0.9

# Not satisfied, penalty should be -ln(0.05)
B<9 always confidence 0.9

# Penalty should be -ln(0.5)
A<5 at time = 4 confidence 0.9 tolerance 1

# Plug into likelihood function
A<4 at time = 4 confidence 0.9 tolerance 1

# Plug into likelihood function
A<6 at time = 4 confidence 0.9 tolerance 2

# 3 vs 6, plug difference of 3 into likelihood function
# C follows the convention (for now) of using the earlier time point if the condition is between time points. 
A at B=8 > C at D=5.45 confidence 1 tolerance 3

# Plug into likelihood function
A<6 at time = 4 pmin 0.1 pmax 0.85 tolerance 2
