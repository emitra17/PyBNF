Installation
============

Operating System
----------------
PyBNF can be installed on any recent Linux or macOS operating system. Windows is not currently supported. 

Python
------

PyBNF requires an installation of Python version 3.5 or higher. This should come built-in with most new Linux and Mac
operating systems.  However, we recommend installing the `Anaconda`_ Python distribution for Python v3.5 or higher.
Installing Anaconda facilitates managing and installing Python packages as well as maintaining multiple Python
environments. Instructions for installing on various platforms can be found on the `Anaconda`_ website.

PyBNF
-----
The ``pip`` package manager is included with `Anaconda`_ and should be used to install PyBNF from the command line.

It is also possible to install ``pip`` alone without Anaconda. If you choose to do this, be sure your ``pip`` is associated with Python 3 (on some systems, this command is ``pip3``). 

Installing from PyPI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. note::
    This option is not yet available

Simply type the following in a terminal:

    :command:`pip install pybnf`

The above command will install the most recent version of PyBNF released on the Python Package Index, along with all required dependencies. 

Installing from source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To use bleeding edge PyBNF, the source code may be found on GitHub at https://github.com/lanl/PyBNF .  To use,
simply download or clone the repository and run the following command in the repository's root directory:

    :command:`pip install -e .`

This also allows developers to modify the source code while still having access to the commmand line functionality
anywhere in the filesystem.

(Optional) Logging configuration for remote machines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
By default, PyBNF logs to the file ``bnf_timestamp.log`` to maintain a record of important events in the application.
When running PyBNF on a cluster, some of the logs may be written while on a node distinct from the main thread. If
these logs are desired, the user must configure the scheduler to retrieve these logs.

Upon installation of PyBNF, the dependencies ``dask`` and ``distributed`` should be installed. Installing them will
create a ``.dask/`` folder in the home directory with a single file: ``config.yaml``. Open this file to find a
``logging:`` block containing information for how distributed outputs logs. Add the following line to the file,
appropriately indented:

    :command:`pybnf.algorithms.job: info`

where ``info`` can be any string corresponding to a Python logging level (e.g. ``info``, ``debug``, ``warning``)

Installation of External Simulators
-----------------------------------

BioNetGen
^^^^^^^^^
PyBNF is designed to work with simulators present in the BioNetGen software suite, version 2.3, available for download from 
the `BioNetGen`_ website. Note that for Linux distributions other than Ubuntu, the pre-built binary is unreliable, and it is 
necessary to rebuild BioNetGen from source. The current BioNetGen distribution includes support for both network-based 
simulations and network-free simulations. 

.. _set_bng_path:
\


PyBNF will need to know the location of BioNetGen â€“ specifically the location of the script ``BNG2.pl`` within the
BioNetGen installation. This path can be included in the PyBNF configuration file with the :ref:`bng_command <bng_command>` key. 
A convenient alternative is to set the environment variable ``BNGPATH`` to the BioNetGen directory using the following command:

    :command:`export BNGPATH=/path/to/bng2`

where ``/path/to/bng2`` is the path to the folder containing ``BNG2.pl``, not including the "BNG2.pl" file name. This 
setting may be made permanent as of your next login, by copying above command into the file ``.bash_profile``
in your home directory.

SBML
^^^^
PyBNF runs simulations of `SBML`_ models using `libroadrunner`_, which is installed automatically through ``pip`` as part of 
PyBNF installation. 

To work with SBML files, it is useful to install software such as `COPASI`_ that is capable of reading and writing models in
SBML format.
